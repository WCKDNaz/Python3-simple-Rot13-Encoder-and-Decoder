## Encoder Code
import codecs
print ("Enter text that you'd like to encode in ROT-13")
plaintext = input()
ciphertext = codecs.encode(plaintext,'rot_13')
print ("Your cipher is: ", ciphertext)

## Decoder Code
import codecs
print ("Enter ROT-13 Cipher that you'd like to decode")
ciphertext = input()
decode = codecs.decode(ciphertext,'rot_13')
print ("Your decoded ciphertext is: ", decode)


## Enjoy, I guess.
